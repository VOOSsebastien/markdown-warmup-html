        In my entire formation i got some technical and educational skills or knowledge that could be interesting to develop different programming subjects . 
         I can speak easily in public , even if there is a huge crowd it doesn't really impact my stress or  my way of presenting .
        
         An other important point is that i don't have any expectations about my place in a working group , i can take as leadership , mediation , oral presentation , i can make the doc presentatino part even if my creativity isn't my main skill . 
        
         i also manage working in english so i can translate or oraly present a project either in english or in french .
